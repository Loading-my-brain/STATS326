# Time Series Analysis

By utilizing the `tidyverse` and `lubridate` packages, I showcased the essential aspects of time series analysis and forecasting. Thoroughly examining the data and identifying an appropriate model are crucial for generating accurate forecasts. These data-driven strategies empower companies to make informed decisions that have a significant impact on their operations.

## Key Components Demonstrated in the Projects:

- [x] **Data Analysis**: Inspected seasonal patterns, cyclicity, outliers, groupings, trends, multicollinearity, autocorrelation, white noise characteristics, and peaks/troughs.
- [x] **Transformations and Adjustments**: mathematical and Box-Cox transformations, as well as adjustments for calendar, population, and inflation.
- [x] **Decompositions**: Implemented classical and STL decompositions.
- [x] **Moving Average**: Employed moving average methods.
- [x] **Simple Forecasting Methods**: Utilized average, naïve, seasonal naïve, and random walk methods, including drift.
- [x] **Residual Diagnostics**: Conducted diagnostics on forecast residuals.
- [x] **Forecast Distributions**: Explored the distribution of forecasts.
- [x] **Prediction Intervals**: Calculated prediction intervals using yT+h|T ± 1.96σˆh.
- [x] **Modelling and Forecasting with Transformations**: Developed models and forecasts with transformations and bias-adjusted back-transformed means.
- [x] **Forecasting with Decomposition**: Incorporated decomposition in forecasting.
- [x] **Training and Test Sets**: Split data into training and test sets for evaluation.
- [x] **Measures of Accuracy**: Utilized MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE for accuracy assessment.
- [x] **Time Series Regression**: Applied linear, multiple linear, and Fourier series (harmonic regression) models.
- [x] **Intervention Variables**: Considered the impact of intervention variables in modeling.
- [x] **Information Criterion**: Evaluated models using AIC, AICc, and BIC.
- [x] **ETS Models**: Explored exponential smoothing state space models.
- [x] **Model Selection**: Investigated simple exponential smoothing, Holt’s linear, additive/multiplicative damped trend, and multiplicative/additive Holt-Winters’ methods.
- [x] **ARIMA Models**: Analyzed autoregressive integrated moving average models.
